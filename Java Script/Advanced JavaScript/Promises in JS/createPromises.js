//Will learn how to use create Promises and why Its need
//Promise is a object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
// promised are used tackles the flaws/issues of callback functions like: CallBack hell -> issue with readability of code
//2. Inversion of control: means giving access to third party like envirnment functions or taking funciton from runtime env of browser
//properties of promises:  1. status -> pendin(when we initailized promises it always in pending state) -> fullfilled or rejected and once it completed state cant change the status fromrejected or fulfilled whether the value can be change
// value of promise can not change without state change i.e. if promise is in pending state then value is always undefined
// 2. value 3. Onfullfillment 4. Onrejection 
// we can use it like asyc n sync call back function // it is special kind of object having placeholder for future task like callback
// 1. initailize promise 2. resolve promise 3. reject promise 4
// 5. then 6. catch 7. finally 8. all 9.
// 10. race 11. allSettled 12. any 13. all
// 14. Promise.race 15. Promise.allSettled 16. Promise.any
// 17. Promise.all 18. Promise.resolve 19. Promise.reject 20. Promise
